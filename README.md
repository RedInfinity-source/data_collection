# About

This project uses Python and libraries like praw, pandas, sklearn, and openpyxl to collect data from randomly selected subreddits on Reddit. It retrieves information about top posts, including title, score, and comments, and stores it in an Excel spreadsheet for analysis. A decision tree classifier from the sklearn library is used to predict the title of a post based on its score and comments. The classifier is trained on the collected data and used to predict the title of a new post. This project showcases how Python can be used to analyze data from social media platforms like Reddit, providing insights into post popularity and user engagement.

# Features

The project uses Python and various libraries to collect and analyze data from Reddit. It uses the praw library to retrieve information about top posts, including titles, scores, and comments. The collected data is organized and stored in an Excel spreadsheet, serving as a structured repository for further analysis. A decision tree classifier from the sklearn library is used to train the classifier on the collected data, learning patterns based on post scores and comments. The classifier predicts the title of a new post based on its score and comments, providing insights into the post's content. The project also provides insights into post popularity and user engagement, demonstrating how Python can be a powerful tool for extracting valuable insights from social media platforms like Reddit.
