# Reddit Post Prediction
This repository contains a Python script that fetches data from random subreddits on Reddit, collects information about posts, and makes predictions about the points and number of answers a given post might receive. The script uses the PRAW library to interact with Reddit's API and the scikit-learn library to create a prediction model.

## Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/): Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): The Python Reddit API Wrapper for interacting with Reddit.
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): A popular data manipulation library.
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/): A machine learning library for Python.
- [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): A library for reading and writing Excel files.

You can install these dependencies using pip:
pip install praw pandas scikit-learn openpyxl

Usage

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

    Navigate to the project directory:
cd Reddit-Post-Prediction

    Open the Python script (reddit_post_prediction.py) and add your Reddit API credentials:

python

reddit = praw.Reddit(client_id='', client_secret='', user_agent='')

    Run the script:

bash

python reddit_post_prediction.py

The script will fetch data from random subreddits, collect information about posts, and make predictions about the points and number of answers a post might receive.
Configuration

You can customize the subreddits the script collects data from by modifying the random_subreddit list in the script. Feel free to add or remove subreddits as needed.

python

random_subreddit = ['ask', 'AskHistorians', 'NoStupidQuestions', 'AskScienceFiction', 'AskReddit', 'AskRedditAfterDark', 'Question', 'questions']

Data Storage

The script saves collected data in an Excel file (New Microsoft Excel Worksheet.xlsx). You can change the save location by modifying the following line:

Prediction Model

The script uses a Decision Tree Classifier from scikit-learn to make predictions about the points and number of answers a post might receive. The model is trained on the collected data.
